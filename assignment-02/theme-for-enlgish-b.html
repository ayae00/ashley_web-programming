    <h1>Theme for English B</h1>
    <h2>Langston Hughes<br>
        1951
    </h2>
        <p>The instructor said,<br>
            <br>
            <em>Go home and write<br>
                a page tonight.<br>
                And let that page come out of you—<br>
                Then, it will be true.</em><br>
            <br>
      I wonder if it’s that simple?<br>
      I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.<br>
      I went to school there, then Durham, then here <br>
      to this college on the hill above Harlem. <br>  
      I am the only colored student in my class. <br>  
      The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,<br>   
      through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,<br>   
      Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y, <br>  
      the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator <br>  
      up to my room, sit down, and write this page:<br>
      <br>
      It’s not easy to know what is true for you or me <br>
      at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I’m what<br>
      I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you.<br>
      hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.<br>   
      (I hear New York, too.) Me—who?<br>
      <br>
      Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.<br>   
      I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.<br>   
      I like a pipe for a Christmas present,<br>
      or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach.<br>
      I guess being colored doesn’t make me not like<br>
      the same things other folks like who are other races.<br>   
      So will my page be colored that I write?   <br>
      Being me, it will not be white.<br>
      But it will be<br>
      a part of you, instructor.<br>
      You are white—<br>
      yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.<br>
      That’s American.<br>
      Sometimes perhaps you don’t want to be a part of me. <br>  
      Nor do I often want to be a part of you.<br>
      But we are, that’s true!<br>
      As I learn from you,<br>
      I guess you learn from me—<br>
      although you’re older—and white—<br>
      and somewhat more free.<br>
      <br>
      This is my page for English B.
