    <h1>The Weary Blues</h1>
    <h2>Langston Hughes<br>
        1926
    </h2>
        <p>Droning a drowsy syncopated tune, <br>
            Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon, <br>
            I heard a Negro play.<br>
            Down on Lenox Avenue the other night<br>
            By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light<br>
            He did a lazy sway. . . .<br>
            He did a lazy sway. . . .<br>
            To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.<br>
            With his ebony hands on each ivory key<br>
            He made that poor piano moan with melody.<br>
            O Blues!<br>
            Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool<br>
            He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.<br>
            Sweet Blues!<br>
            Coming from a black man’s soul.<br>
            O Blues!<br>
            In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone<br>
            I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—<br>
            “Ain’t got nobody in all this world,<br>
            Ain’t got nobody but ma self.<br>
            I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’<br>
            And put ma troubles on the shelf.”<br>
            <br>
            Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.<br>
            He played a few chords then he sang some more—<br>
            “I got the Weary Blues<br>
            And I can’t be satisfied.<br>
            Got the Weary Blues<br>
            And can’t be satisfied—<br>
            I ain’t happy no mo’<br>
            And I wish that I had died.”<br>
            And far into the night he crooned that tune.<br>
            The stars went out and so did the moon.<br>
            The singer stopped playing and went to bed<br>
            While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.<br>
            He slept like a rock or a man that’s dead.<br>
