    <h1>A Bird, came down the Walk</h1>
    <h2>Emily Dickinson<br>
        1891
    </h2>
        <p>A Bird, came down the Walk - <br>
            He did not know I saw -<br>
            He bit an Angle Worm in halves<br>
            And ate the fellow, raw, <br>
            <br>
            And then, he drank a Dew<br>
            From a convenient Grass -<br>
            And then hopped sidewise to the Wall<br>
            To let a Beetle pass -<br>
            <br>
            He glanced with rapid eyes,<br>
            That hurried all abroad -<br>
            They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,<br>
            He stirred his Velvet Head. - <br>
            <br>
            Like one in danger, Cautious,<br>
            I offered him a Crumb,<br>
            And he unrolled his feathers, <br>
            And rowed him softer Home -<br>
            <br>
            Than Oars divide the Ocean,<br>
            Too silver for a seam,<br>
            Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon,<br>
            Leap, plashless as they swim.<br>
