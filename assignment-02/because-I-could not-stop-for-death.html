    <h1>Because I could not stop for Death</h1>
    <h2>Emily Dickinson<br>
        1890
    </h2>
        <p>Because I could not stop for Death –<br>
            He kindly stopped for me –<br>
            The Carriage held but just Ourselves –<br>
            And Immortality.<br>
            <br>
            We slowly drove – He knew no haste<br>
            And I had put away<br>
            My labor and my leisure too,<br>
            For His Civility –<br>
            <br>
            We passed the School, where Children strove<br>
            At Recess – in the Ring –<br>
            We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –<br>
            We passed the Setting Sun –<br>
            <br>
            Or rather – He passed Us –<br>
            The Dews drew quivering and Chill –<br>
            For only Gossamer, my Gown –<br>
            My Tippet – only Tulle –<br>
            <br>
            We paused before a House that seemed<br>
            A Swelling of the Ground –<br>
            The Roof was scarcely visible –<br>
            The Cornice – in the Ground –<br>
            <br>
            Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet<br>
            Feels shorter than the Day<br>
            I first surmised the Horses' Heads<br>
            Were toward Eternity –<br>
        </p>
