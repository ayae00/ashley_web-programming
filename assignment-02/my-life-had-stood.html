    <h1>My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun</h1>
    <h2>Emily Dickinson<br>
        1863
    </h2>
        <p>My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -<br>
            In Corners - till a Day<br>
            The Owner passed - identified -<br>
            And carried Me away -<br>
            <br>
            And now We roam in Sovreign Woods -<br>
            And now We hunt the Doe -<br>
            And every time I speak for Him<br>
            The Mountains straight reply -<br>
            <br>
            And do I smile, such cordial light<br>
            Opon the Valley glow -<br>
            It is as a Vesuvian face<br>
            Had let it’s pleasure through -<br>
            <br>
            And when at Night - Our good Day done -<br>
            I guard My Master’s Head -<br>
            ’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s<br>
            Deep Pillow - to have shared -<br>
            <br>
            To foe of His - I’m deadly foe -<br>
            None stir the second time -<br>
            On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -<br>
            Or an emphatic Thumb -<br>
            <br>
            Though I than He - may longer live<br>
            He longer must - than I -<br>
            For I have but the power to kill,<br>
            Without - the power to die -<br>
        </p>
