    <h1>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain</h1>
    <h2>Emily Dickinson<br>
        1861
    </h2>
        <p>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,<br>
            And Mourners to and fro<br>
            Kept treading - treading - till it seemed<br>
            That Sense was breaking through -<br>
            <br>
            And when they all were seated,<br>
            A Service, like a Drum -<br>
            Kept beating - beating - till I thought<br>
            My mind was going numb -<br>
            <br>
            And then I heard them lift a Box<br>
            And creak across my Soul<br>
            With those same Boots of Lead, again,<br>
            Then Space - began to toll,<br>
            <br>
            As all the Heavens were a Bell,<br>
            And Being, but an Ear,<br>
            And I, and Silence, some strange Race,<br>
            Wrecked, solitary, here -<br>
            <br>
            And then a Plank in Reason, broke,<br>
            And I dropped down, and down -<br>
            And hit a World, at every plunge,<br>
            And Finished knowing - then -<br>
        </p>
